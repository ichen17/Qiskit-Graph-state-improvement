# Qiskit-Graph-state-improvement

Because each qubit has decoherence time, we need to shorten circuit depth as possible as we can so that the execution time of each quantum circuit is shorter.
Since the CZ gates on different sites communicate with each other, one can rearrange the order of the CZ gates in order to find the graph state with the shortest execution time.
Moreover, we decompose the CX gate pulse and reconstruct the CZ gate instead of using two hardamard gates and CX gate.





## Graph state class

We create the graph state class to rearrange the CZ gates. One can create the edges list and put it on graph state state class. The best fidelity we achieve is 0.972, of all tests and corresponding Job ID (in [Qiskit-Graph-state-improvement](https://github.com/ichen17/Qiskit-Graph-state-improvement/blob/main/Graph_state_final_version.ipynb)). Although we cannot reproduce such result since April due to the unstable quality of ibmq-casablanca backend. We believe if we are able to retrieve the backend quality as good as the quality on March 3st or March 2nd, the fidelity of graph state generated by circuit 4 or circuit 2 will reach 90 percent.

## CZ_gate pulse

In Qiskit default, two Hadamard gates and one CX gate are used to manifest CZ gate. Here, we create a customized CZ gate pulse to replace the default one. Therefore, we don't need to apply few more Hadamard to apply the CZ gates. The way we create our custom CZ gates is to extract the CR pulse from the CNOT gate and recombine it into CZ gate pulse. Because of insufficient tests for custom CZ gate in ibmq-casablanca, we don't turn it on in our code. However, here are some results executing in ibmq-rome and ibmq-bogota. If one wants to increase the fidelity of graph state by 1~2 %, one can try to turn it on in stabilizer_measure_circuit function.
